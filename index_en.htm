        <h2 id="chapter1">Chapter I: Azeroth</h2>
        <section>
            <p>The history of Azeroth is the story of a world shaped by the Titans, subjugated by the Old Gods, but eventually freed. This world became an arena for many conflicts, including the invasions of the demonic Burning Legion and the wars between factions like the Horde and the Alliance.</p>

            <h3>Early History</h3>
            <p class="legendary-text">Creation: Initially, the planet was inhabited by the Elemental Lords, but then the Old Gods seized them, creating the Black Empire.</p>

            <p>Arrival of the Titans: The Titans discovered the planet and battled the Old Gods to save it from corruption. Ordering the World: After their victory, the Titans ordered Azeroth, creating sentient races (Earthen, Mechagnomes, Vrykul, Mogu, Tol'vir, etc.) and leaving behind Keepers to protect the world.</p>

            <h3>The Rise of Sentient Races</h3>
            <p>Natural Development: Some races, like the Tauren and Trolls, arose naturally. Titan Creation: Humans and Gnomes were created by the Titans. Evolution of the Vrykul: Humans originated from Vrykul who were affected by the Curse of Flesh, created by the Old Gods, which led to the appearance of "small and ugly infants"—the first humans.</p>

            <h3>Conquest and Conflicts</h3>
            <p>Demonic Invasion: The demonic army of the Burning Legion, drawn by the magical energy of the Well of Eternity, invaded Azeroth. War of the Ancients: This led to the Sundering of the single continent and the start of conflicts. Appearance of New Races: New races, such as Orcs and Draenei, arrived in Azeroth and also became participants in the conflicts. Formation of Factions: After the Third War, three main factions formed in the world: the Horde, the Alliance, and the Scourge.</p>

        <h2 id="chapter2">Chapter II: The Rise of the Horde</h2>
        <section>
            <p>The arrival of the Orcs through the Dark Portal is a central event that began the era of wars between the worlds of Azeroth and Draenor. Below is a more detailed description of the key aspects:</p>

        <h3>Background: The Fall of Draenor and the Legion's Corruption</h3>
        <p>The Orcs' homeworld, Draenor, was a flourishing planet where clans lived in harmony with nature and practiced shamanism. However, the appearance of the demon Kil'jaeden from the Burning Legion changed their fate. He tricked the Orcs into believing that the Draenei (refugees hunted by the Legion) were their enemies. After the Draenei's destruction, Kil'jaeden offered the Orcs the blood of the demon Mannoroth in exchange for incredible power. Those who drank the blood (most clans) became slaves to Fel: their skin turned green, and their peaceful culture transformed into a machine of destruction. Draenor began to die due to the demonic energy.</p>

        <h3>Creation of the Dark Portal</h3>
        <p>The despairing Gul'dan, head of the Shadow Council and the most powerful Warlock of the Horde, sought a way to save his people while fulfilling the will of his new master—Sargeras, who manipulated him through Kil'jaeden.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Medivh, Guardian of Tirisfal and the greatest human mage, lived in Azeroth. Since childhood, he had been possessed by the spirit of Sargeras, who had entered his body before birth. Under the fallen Titan's influence, Medivh began to use his immense power to establish a connection with Draenor.</p>

        <h4>Joint Efforts</h4>
        <p class="legendary-text">Medivh in Azeroth and Gul'dan with the Shadow Council in Draenor combined their forces and knowledge of black magic to create a spatial rift—the Dark Portal.</p>

        <h4>Mechanism</h4>
        <p>The Portal was created in the fields of the Blasted Lands in Azeroth and at the Stair of Destiny in Outland (Draenor). Gul'dan's Warlocks used the life energy of captured Draenei to sustain the portal and empower it.</p>

        <h3>Arrival and Invasion</h3>
        <p>Initially, the portal was small, allowing only one Orc to pass through. Scouts were sent first. Following a successful report of a new, wealthy world, free from corruption, the portal was expanded, and the main forces of the Horde poured through.</p>

        <h4>Green Glow</h4>
        <p class="legendary-text">A distinctive feature of the portal was its ominous green glow, symbolizing the fel energy that powered it and the Horde.</p>

        <h4>The First War</h4>
        <p>The arrival of the vast, demonically enhanced army of Orcs was a complete surprise to the unsuspecting Kingdom of Stormwind. This event marked the beginning of the First War, a bloody conflict that forever changed the fate of Azeroth and led to the formation of the Alliance of Lordaeron to counter the threat.</p>

        <p>Thus, the arrival of the Orcs was the result of a carefully planned diabolical intrigue by the Burning Legion, which used two powerful mages from different worlds to carry out its invasion.</p>
</section>

        <h2 id="chapter3">Chapter III: The Rebirth of the Alliance</h2>

        <section>
            <p>The rebirth of the Alliance refers to the formation of the coalition known as the Alliance of Lordaeron, which arose as a direct response to the devastating invasion of the Horde after the First War. This event united the disparate peoples of Azeroth in the face of a common threat.</p>

            <h3>Reasons and Process of Unification</h3>
            <p>After the Orcs destroyed the southern human kingdom of Stormwind, the surviving refugees, led by the young King Varian Wrynn and Regent Anduin Lothar, retreated north to the kingdom of Lordaeron. Lothar, the last of the Arathi line and the commander of Stormwind's forces, realized that no single human kingdom could withstand the might of the Horde alone.</p>

            <h4>The Council of Lordaeron</h4>
            <p>He convened an emergency council with the leaders of the seven human kingdoms and representatives of other races in the capital of Lordaeron:</p>

            <p class="legendary-text">Realization of the Threat: The heads of state, initially fragmented and unwilling to interfere in external conflicts, became convinced of the scale of the threat. The Horde was not merely an army of invaders but a force driven by a lust for destruction.</p>

            <p>Lothar's Diplomacy: Lothar used his authority and evidence of the Horde's atrocities to persuade the leaders of the necessity of unification. Common Goal: All seven human kingdoms agreed that if the Horde was not stopped, it would destroy all of humanity.</p>

            <h3>Composition of the Alliance of Lordaeron</h3>
            <p>This "rebirth" resulted in the formation of a powerful coalition, including:</p>

            <h4>The Seven Human Kingdoms</h4>
            <p>Lordaeron (led by Terenas Menethil), Stormwind (in exile), Kul Tiras (a naval nation commanded by Daelin Proudmoore), Gilneas (the isolationist kingdom of Genn Greymane), Stromgarde (the warrior kingdom of Thoras Trollbane), Alterac (the small kingdom of Aiden Perenolde, which would later betray the Alliance), and Dalaran (the mage city-state governed by the Kirin Tor).</p>

            <h4>Other Races</h4>
            <p class="legendary-text">The Alliance was joined by Dwarves (mainly from the Wildhammer clan) and the High Elves of Quel'Thalas, whose forests were also affected by the Horde.</p>

            <h3>Significance</h3>
            <p>This unification, named the Alliance of Lordaeron, became a turning point in Azeroth's history. It allowed for the gathering of sufficient forces and resources to repel the Horde during the Second War and ultimately achieve victory, albeit at the cost of immense sacrifices and betrayals (such as the treachery of Alterac).</p>
            <p>It was this alliance that laid the foundation for the modern Alliance, which continues to exist as a coalition of races united by common ideals and the necessity of defending Azeroth.</p>
        </section>

        <h2 id="chapter4">Chapter IV: The Threat of the Scourge</h2>

        <section>
            <p>The Threat of the Scourge represents one of the darkest and most destructive periods in Azeroth's history, directly linked to the fall of Prince Arthas Menethil and the destruction of the kingdom of Lordaeron. The Scourge is a vast army of Undead, operating as a single organism under the telepathic control of its master, the Lich King.</p>

            <h3>Origin and Goal</h3>
            <p>The Scourge was created by the will of the Burning Legion. The demon Kil'jaeden transformed the captured spirit of the Orc Shaman Ner'zhul into the first Lich King and imprisoned his soul in a block of ice—the Frozen Throne. The Frozen Throne was sent to Azeroth (Northrend) with a single goal: to create an army that would weaken the world and pave the way for a new Legion invasion.</p>
            <p>Ner'zhul, in his icy prison, began experimenting with necromancy, subjugating the local fauna of Northrend and creating the plague of undeath.</p>

            <h3>Spread of the Threat (The Third War)</h3>
            <p>A key moment was the spread of the plague of undeath in the northern human kingdom of Lordaeron. Ner'zhul, through his servants (notably the Necromancer Kel'Thuzad), infected granaries with plague-ridden grain. People who consumed this grain died and immediately rose as mindless Undead, swelling the ranks of the Scourge.</p>

            <p>The young Prince Arthas Menethil, attempting to save his people from the unknown disease, gradually succumbed to madness from powerlessness and despair. The Lich King manipulated him, forcing him to take extreme measures, including a dubious campaign to Northrend, where Arthas found the cursed runeblade—Frostmourne. By taking the blade, Arthas damned his soul and became the first Death Knight in the Lich King's service.</p>

            <p class="legendary-text">Returning to Lordaeron, Arthas murdered his own father, King Terenas Menethil, and took command of the Scourge. Under his leadership, the Undead destroyed the capital of Lordaeron and subsequently other kingdoms, including the Elven Quel'Thalas.</p>

            <h3>The Nature of the Threat</h3>
            <p>The threat of the Scourge lies in its ability to self-replicate and its lack of fear of death. Any slain opponent, if their body is not destroyed in a special way (for example, with the use of Light magic), can be resurrected as a new soldier for the Undead army.</p>

            <p class="legendary-text">The Scourge army is a ruthless and strategically controlled force. Individual Undead possess no free will; they are tools in the hands of the Lich King, who controls them through a powerful telepathic link.</p>

            <p>This collective entity made the Scourge an extremely effective and dangerous enemy for both the Alliance and the Horde, and later—even for its creators, the Burning Legion, whose influence the Lich King eventually broke free from.</p>
        </section>

        <h2 id="chapter5">Chapter V: The Cataclysm and The Sundering</h2>
        <section>
            <p>Warcraft history describes two different, but equally destructive events, which occurred ten thousand years apart.</p>

            <h3>The Great Sundering</h3>
            <p>This catastrophic event occurred approximately 10,000 years ago and was a consequence of the War of the Ancients.</p>

            <h4>Cause and Event</h4>
            <p>During the Burning Legion's first invasion, the Night Elves used the Well of Eternity, a powerful source of arcane magic, to open a portal for the demons. At the end of the war, the druid Malfurion Stormrage attempted to destroy this portal using the Dragon Soul artifact. The destabilized Well of Eternity exploded, causing a chain reaction of cataclysms across the world. About 80% of the then-single supercontinent Kalimdor sank to the bottom of the ocean.</p>

            <h4>Consequences of the Sundering</h4>
            <p class="legendary-text">The world was split into the continents we know today: the Eastern Kingdoms, Northrend, Pandaria, and the remainder of Kalimdor. An eternal, raging vortex, the Maelstrom, formed in the center of the new ocean, serving as a constant reminder of the catastrophe.</p>
            <p>The Highborne elves who remained near the ruins transformed into the malicious, serpentine Naga. Most of the original life on Azeroth perished.</p>

            <h3>Deathwing's Cataclysm</h3>
            <p>This is a later event, which formed the basis of the World of Warcraft expansion of the same name and occurred within the current timeline.</p>

            <h4>Cause and Event</h4>
            <p class="legendary-text">The Old God Neltharion, the Black Dragon Aspect who went mad from the whispers of the Old Gods and became known as Deathwing the Destroyer, broke free from the Deepholm (the Elemental plane) back into Azeroth. By shattering the boundaries between the planes of existence, Deathwing's emergence caused a chain of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, and other natural disasters across the globe. This event reshaped the landscape of Azeroth and weakened the borders between the elemental world and physical reality.</p>

            <h4>Consequences of the Cataclysm</h4>
            <p>The geography of many old Azeroth zones was irreversibly changed (e.g., the volcanic eruption on Kezan, the destruction of the Greymane Wall in Gilneas). The peoples of Azeroth (the Alliance and the Horde) were forced to fight for survival in a new, dangerous world, leading to a new cycle of conflicts. Elementals, previously confined to their dimensions, poured into Azeroth, threatening its existence.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, the combined forces of heroes and the Dragon Aspects defeated Deathwing, but the price of victory was high—the dragons lost their immortality.</p>
            <p>Both events drastically changed the face of Azeroth and influenced the course of its history.</p>
